Throughout the 1990s and well into the first decade of the new millennium, the eastern German states faced signifi- cant population losses (Table 1). Young, well-educated East Germans—especially young women—moved to western German states in search of work. Indeed, this trend continues to influence average age and birth rates to this day and will also affect future generations. Although this out-­migration halted in the 2010s, eastern German states are still expected to experience population declines in the future. 11 For decades, the eastern states already have had to adjust their bugets to declinig tax shares year after year, while the western German states benefit from rising populations.

It is not inconceivable that the financially strong states will soon demand a reduction in their equalization payments and once again threaten to take legal action in the Federal Constitutional Court. Historically, though, the financially strong states have certainly profited from the situation. For them, eastern Germany’s shrinking population, along with similar demographic trends in other structurally weak states, has meant an influx of young, well-educated people. These migration flows have opposing effects on potential economic growth in the states. The eastern German states have also had to accept smaller shares of tax revenue every year, while the opposite has been the case for their financially stronger coun- terparts. Such developments narrow or expand the budgetary leeway that the federal states can use for effective regional development policy. Regardless, it is important to prevent financially strong states from shirking their responsibility, especially given that the last reform of the fiscal equaliza- tion system allowed them to shift part of their financial bur- den onto the federal government, which is currently facing a host of other challenges.",page_8_block_1,,283.46,206.85,512.72,482.48,9.28,normal,right,en,English,1.0,ltr,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,1350,201,8,201,5.721393034825871,False,True,True,True,0.4724333333333333,0.24569717706698055,0.8545333333333334,0.5730914865423098,0.6634833333333334,0.4093943318046452,0.16348333333333342,0.9,False,False,paragraph,5,0.37999999999999545,paragraph,5,-261.35,10,0.3,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

Put simply, economic power roughly reflects the basis of local tax revenue. The economic power of east- ern German federal states still lags behind that of the west- ern states and, due to long-established structures, conver- gence is slow. This persistent gap becomes even more evi- dent when we look at the states’ tax revenue. This is the result not only of lower assets, but, more importantly, of the pro- gressive tax system, according to which tax rates rise in line with the taxpayer’s ability to pay. Under the existing fiscal equalization system, this is transferred to the federal states. The more affluent – as in having a greater ability to pay – federal states must make compensation payments, while the poorer states are the recipients of these transfers. With the fundamental goal of convergence, a high level of redistribu- tion in German fiscal federalism is inevitable.",page_8_block_1,,42.52,254.85,271.67,446.48,9.2,normal,left,en,English,1.0,ltr,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,965,159,8,159,5.0754716981132075,False,True,True,True,0.07086666666666668,0.3027117504255257,0.45278333333333337,0.5303305565234009,0.261825,0.41652115347446333,0.23817500000000003,0.9,False,False,paragraph,5,9.530000000000001,paragraph,5,12.370000000000005,10,0.5,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

By Kristina van Deuverden
• Financial capacity and economic power of eastern German states still below average 35 years
after unification
• But former East German states catching up with financially weak western German counterparts;
gap between rich and poor widening nationwide
• In the long run, population declines—particularly in eastern Germany—amplify uneven
development, increasing the need for equalization payments
• Scenario calculations show that, if trends over the last decade continue, disparities are likely to
grow until 2070
• Financially strong states should assume more responsibility, while poorer states should be
strengthened in the long term, irrespective of geographical location
The gap between the rich and poor states is widening more and more

“35 years since German unification, the former East German states are increasingly
closing the gap on their financially weak western German counterparts. Today the divide
is no longer between east and west but between rich and poor.”
